"Marla Lamont","Very disappointed with their customer service. There was a problem checking in with my bank card. At the end of the day, nothing was wrong with my card at all. The error was on their end. The woman at the front desk was rude and her behavior was unacceptable. After I insisted she enter the number manually, it went through fine. I will never stay their again. A shame, the hotel was beautiful. I wish she had a name badge on because I would add to the review if I knew her name.","2.0","5.0","","2 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115504476516996544831/reviews?hl=en-KH&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwivp-Pao8XvAhWywosBHWyAD6kQvfQBegQIARAw","www.google.com","","Virgin Hotels Nashville","117","4.4","1 Music Square W, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIs5bYh6ei0JqnARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=ELOW2IenotCapwEQs5bYh6ei0JqnATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwj4sqK0o8XvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjcwMTYzODI4ZDE5OjB4YTczNTQxMTI3MGY2MGIzMxoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYHhIHCOUPEAMYHxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac"

Staff is top notch - everyone from the desk staff, to the pool club, to the woman at the coffee shop who got me my coffee even though she wasn't supposed to open for 10 more minutes.

"Tylesha McCray","My colleague and I visited the hotel midday in hopes of dining at the Pool Club rooftop restaurant and bar. Upon entrance there was no one to greet us. After a few minutes we approached an employee by the bar. In a brusque tone she said that we could seat ourselves anywhere inside the restaurant, but that it was a 20 minute wait for food. We found a table and sat down, another 5-10 minutes went by and no one came to acknowledge our presence. It was my first time visiting the hotel, my colleague had gone a few days prior and loved the ambiance. This experience was dismal and we ended up leaving and going to another restaurant.","1.0","5.0","","5 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111686033584081260948/reviews?hl=en-UA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjojfPfo8XvAhWK3YUKHTUFCk0QvfQBegQIARAa","www.google.com","","Virgin Hotels Nashville","117","4.4","1 Music Square W, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIs5bYh6ei0JqnARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=ELOW2IenotCapwEQs5bYh6ei0JqnATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwj4sqK0o8XvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjcwMTYzODI4ZDE5OjB4YTczNTQxMTI3MGY2MGIzMxoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYHhIHCOUPEAMYHxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac"

"Amm W","This was our first time in Nashville. And we had the best time due in large part because of the hotel. During the pandemic: everyone has a mask, hand sanitizer stations everywhere, AND complimentary hand sanitizer and gloves at the front desk when you check in. Rooftop bar: ok it was gorgeous and the staff was so friendly!! There were plenty of heaters in our space and the music was fun! Danni at the front desk checked us in and she was perfect. Seriously so nice. Friendly, knowledgeable and so helpful! She gave us a ton of recommendations for our first time out. A lot of our family that we met up with were impressed that ""we had that much money to throw around""...for everything you get with this place it was worth it! Also- it was less than 250 a night, that's not that bad for a big city like Nashville.

"ginger courtney","Cool space and nice spacious rooms. But room service stops at 11 am. Not pm but am. So that alone would probably be the only reason to not book there again. However, if that does not bother you, book it! The room service for breakfast is one of the best I've ever had. Also, the location allows you to walk to the bars and restaurants on Demonbreun and midtown (Kung Fu, Red Door, Dogwood, etc).

The room was more style than substance. Was asked a million questions about my likes and dislikes to become part of their rewards and I now feel it was to sell my personal data because the staff provided nothing to me upon arrival or throughout my stay.

"Isaac Fowler","A note on the hotel and a few helpful tips (e.g. parking!) Really great hotel. Love the updated, trendy decor and amenities. A+ for that! Just see the pictures for examples. It’s easy walking distance from a ton of great options. Some tips to make the most of your stay... Parking. There is no official parking other than valet which is very expensive here (over $40 currently). Not too surprising considering it’s Nashville and all parking is expensive. Immediately next door is a public parking lot that has overnight parking for less than $10 at the time that I’m writing this. It’s a very short walk if you want to save the money. Restaurants. If you’re like me, it’d never occur to you to make a reservation at a hotel restaurant. This one you should. The rooftop restaurant was booked up with a super long wait when we tried to go which is unfortunate because the wife was really looking forward to the winter themed option with s’mores. If you want to go, consider a reservation. For that matter, you should make a reservation if you go out too, because most of the restaurants in the area fill up fast.","5.0","5.0","","3 weeks ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111034454488866926175/reviews?hl=en-JP&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRvabYo8XvAhXWad4KHbXJDgAQvfQBegQIARBl","www.google.com","","Virgin Hotels Nashville","117","4.4","1 Music Square W, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIs5bYh6ei0JqnARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=ELOW2IenotCapwEQs5bYh6ei0JqnATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwj4sqK0o8XvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjcwMTYzODI4ZDE5OjB4YTczNTQxMTI3MGY2MGIzMxoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYHhIHCOUPEAMYHxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac"

"Adam Peter Shinn","Overall we had a great experience during our stay. The rooms are amazing and come stocked with tons of goodies in and by the fridge. The motion sensor lights and accompanying app are really nice touches. And the “shower room” was fantastic. The bed is one of the most comfy beds I’ve ever slept on. No details are spared on the design especially in the lobby. The amenities are plentiful and we loved the happy hour drink specials. We would definitely come back. So why only 4 stars? We didn’t have the best experience leaving. The receptionist checking us out of our room decided to shout our grand total loud enough for everyone in earshot of the lobby to hear and the bell hop staff wouldn’t accept that we could handle our own luggage (they weren’t mean, but insisted on trying to help us even after we said we were fine). Otherwise, they’re worth checking out and we were mostly satisfied with our stay.","4.0","5.0","","3 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116453597789994667978/reviews?hl=en-MY&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG8aTeo8XvAhXzzjgGHVYYCh8QvfQBegQIARAY","www.google.com","","Virgin Hotels Nashville","117","4.4","1 Music Square W, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIs5bYh6ei0JqnARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=ELOW2IenotCapwEQs5bYh6ei0JqnATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwj4sqK0o8XvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjcwMTYzODI4ZDE5OjB4YTczNTQxMTI3MGY2MGIzMxoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYHhIHCOUPEAMYHxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac"

The service was top notch from check in to check out and we felt so welcome.

"Michael B","Nice room, comfortable bed, very dog friendly. As in the dogs came into the Pool Club restaurant. Nit pickings: Shower head is too small so the water doesn’t cover your body when it falls down from the ceiling. Water pressure is low, common problem in America. Room lacked basic necessities. Bathrobes, toothbrushes and slippers. There are glass bottles in the minibar but no bottle opener. 😅 Sorry but I think this should be in the room and I don’t want to call and ask for it. Hard product is solid but the soft product needs a touch up. No introduction to the hotel was given at check in. Room is on the smaller side. Even though we are Expedia VIP access, nothing was mentioned about a room upgrade. Sad. We have two dogs, one small dog bed and two small dog bowls (one wasn’t clean) was delivered to the room. Recommend some treats and dog toys. $38 per night for parking is a bit absurd especially during Covid and I think free street parking exists too. Arm robbery not necessary, please welcome travellers to get back in the habit.

"thomas bresnahan","We stayed in the king room city view for one night. The room itself was nice but a little on the small side. The customer service on the other hand was not very good. They charged an extra $150 for possible incidentals which I've been told will be refunded if there are none (we'll see). This would have been fine with me if we would have been told up front instead of finding out after our stay. Secondly, or card was ran at the bar for drinks and was told that it didn't go through, so I gave them another card and it worked fine. Later on checked my account and it went through on the first try. So now I'm trying to get that money back. Probably will never stay there again.","2.0","5.0","","3 weeks ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113618907238775071465/reviews?hl=en-JP&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRvabYo8XvAhXWad4KHbXJDgAQvfQBegQIARBy","www.google.com","","Virgin Hotels Nashville","117","4.4","1 Music Square W, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIs5bYh6ei0JqnARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=ELOW2IenotCapwEQs5bYh6ei0JqnATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwj4sqK0o8XvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjcwMTYzODI4ZDE5OjB4YTczNTQxMTI3MGY2MGIzMxoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYHhIHCOUPEAMYHxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac"

They had a tiny photo of Dolly Parton on the bottom of the ice cube in our drinks! 10/10 would return especially in warmer weather.","5.0","5.0","","3 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793217891602046885/reviews?hl=en-BG&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjm0cvdo8XvAhWDx4UKHVoYBAEQvfQBegQIARAV","www.google.com","","Virgin Hotels Nashville","117","4.4","1 Music Square W, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIs5bYh6ei0JqnARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=ELOW2IenotCapwEQs5bYh6ei0JqnATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwj4sqK0o8XvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjcwMTYzODI4ZDE5OjB4YTczNTQxMTI3MGY2MGIzMxoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYHhIHCOUPEAMYHxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJGY2CYwFnZIgRMwv2cBJBNac"
