They don't have room service, but the hotel offers so much, it wasn't an issue.","5.0","5.0","","5 months ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9I6BxZNRMgwB6LTW9miTdIYKQ1TcSAxPCv9ef | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkFGccoIk4tGVhGQAAQduQzMjBocq5Ln-atEiu | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5zIo8ptP6zR6LP7SW7rxOgTG7WdmbaRQ9NQ8Y | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEBWbyKf4X4_EG0q35rK123vujdqes7PrkQFQC | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHeR4W-uXuMMrXs8A7Qg-ubSDc2ybTcaldXhtI | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8n52MTEQdK1IWCV5fE7NLryeiZpp3YhKMfCQ7 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3PsPOjwmueDYuO3a9eM9XJYj-CkJVTdExmiaf | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjyzuwok3lQOSSdRHiSymVN_3wc2aWNa4cMhVs | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzFaKUKS23k-7XH_vQmPawXW72JxflHTaRl76T","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117284527263947441344/reviews?hl=en-UY&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiP85vLmMXvAhV_E7kGHf5zCvsQvfQBegQIARAr","www.google.com","","Bobby Hotel","656","4,6","230 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIwpqN7I7647TuARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=EMKajeyO-uO07gEQwpqN7I7647TuATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwio_MejmMXvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjY1OWNjYWZlZTlmOjB4ZWU2OThmZDBlZDgzNGQ0MhoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYFhIHCOUPEAMYFxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4"

"Elizabeth Ridgway","Very hip hotel within walking distance to the hot spots in Nashville. Staff was very nice & accommodating. We got a massage at the spa - Jackie was wonderful. They do not do couples messages however- only individual which we did not know when we booked it. Our only complaints the reason we took off a star is the room had a lot of dust, hair, etc that was missed by housekeeping. I would expect more of such an expensive hotel. Also, there is a $45 per day parking charge that we missed in the fine print. They are not upfront about that charge.","4.0","5.0","","5 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108712448407883852494/reviews?hl=en-UY&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiP85vLmMXvAhV_E7kGHf5zCvsQvfQBegQIARAe","www.google.com","","Bobby Hotel","656","4,6","230 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIwpqN7I7647TuARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=EMKajeyO-uO07gEQwpqN7I7647TuATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwio_MejmMXvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjY1OWNjYWZlZTlmOjB4ZWU2OThmZDBlZDgzNGQ0MhoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYFhIHCOUPEAMYFxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4"

"Crystal Shell","SORT on review rating--I should've done that before booking! Okay so let's get the COVID excuse out of the way first. I was actually glad that there was so much dust in my room because it was proof (hopefully) that it had not been occupied. I brought my own cleaning supplies just in case. NOW...we're staying in a large suite (350.00 per night)...no coffee maker, no small table to eat in the room. The balcony area YOU MUST SEE TO BELIEVE (photos included). We waited 30 minutes for remote control for the tv (watched the weather channel for 30 minutes). We ordered room service this morning and it arrived in cardboard boxes --the food itself was just in the boxes, not plated NOTHING!! The boxes were greasy and marked with a number that was scribbled over as if they had been reused. No salt and pepper--did I mention no microwave (this is a suite). Lastly the sheets and duvet on the bed smell sour as if they put the sheets on still damp. Pretty sad get away. So let's recap--you want coffee or ice you have to call for it and wait and wait.

"Khalia Rainey","I tried booking the Rooftop Igloos for a birthday dinner. I received an email stating there was a $250 minimum, which was fine, and that they would send a menu to pre-order shareable food only. I wasn‚Äôt elated about only having options for shareable food but decided It was fine since the front counter staff stated I would have another menu (individual plates)to choose from as well. I waited about a week and a half and received the worst menu I‚Äôve ever encountered. The ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù preorder menu consisted of only 6 shareable items and the rooftop lounge menu has 4 individual plates that could be ordered when you arrived. I guess they expect for people to spend majority of the 250 in drinks (which is a great business strategy) but not worth it to the consumers. I was looking for something whimsical for my birthday but I‚Äôd rather lose my $50 deposit than spend over $300 with tax and tip for a plastic tent with lights and cocktails. I can go to a five start restaurant with a better experience, better food and better service for less. There‚Äôs also a 90 minute time limit for anyone considering the igloos.","1.0","5.0","","a month ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117926259398629520299/reviews?hl=en-EC&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjfg47ImMXvAhWFq1kKHX7oBHMQvfQBegQIARAI","www.google.com","","Bobby Hotel","656","4,6","230 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIwpqN7I7647TuARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=EMKajeyO-uO07gEQwpqN7I7647TuATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwio_MejmMXvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjY1OWNjYWZlZTlmOjB4ZWU2OThmZDBlZDgzNGQ0MhoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYFhIHCOUPEAMYFxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4"

Outstanding service from the Valet to the studio suite amentities to the restuarant to those at check-in and the superb housekeeping/room cleanliness (not to mention the BEST coffee served anywhere in the world).

"Heather H","For our 16th anniversary, we ventured downtown to this awesome place.. The Bobby really is amazing inside! Loved the decor. The room was nice, but there was ALOT of wasted space, which may have been why the AC just couldn't cool the entire room. The temperature could have been why the bed just seemed uncomfortable, but there wasn't alot of restful sleep because of this. My BIG issue is that we were really looking forward to going up to the rooftop lounge to see the view and decor up there, come to find out, they only do reservations, even if you don't want to rent an igloo. So I never made it put on the roof. Not a fan of the shower, it had a half door, meaning it stayed open. So when you take a warm shower, you're constantly getting a draft and then there's also water all over the floor, so kind disappointing. We ordered room service on our final night and I think they forgot about us because it took forever and the food was disappointing üòï.

Lance, worked the front desk an he went above an beyond our expectations offering quality customer service. We had reserved an igloo at the rooftop bar an let me say the decor was absolutely gorgeous. Our server was on point never missing a beat. The drinks was not watered down, an the food was delicious. Our spa experience was whimsical, both me an my husband hand our kinks worked an an we fell asleep. Would recommend to anybody. We will be returning!

"Johna Davis","Overall a beautiful hotel but not the luxury experience I expected for the price. Best part was the hotel dog Sasha. She was a sweetie! Still a very nice place in downtown Nashville but I'd def recommend a little TLC to improve for future guest! See pros and cons below. Pros: Staff were very nice (Brought us extra blankets, pillows, key for fridge and ice when needed) Large Rooms Modern bathroom (I see other reviews didnt like the glass walls but I thought it was very cool.. theres a curtain for privacy) Valet was fast Boutique Style Art & Decor Close to Broadway, Printers Alley & all the cool spots downtown Cons: Overpriced Room wasnt vacuumed (I'd expect deep cleaning during this crazy COVID 2020) Had to ask for room service TWICE before they came No ice machine/microwave/coffee machine/slippers/robe which I'd expect at such a nice hotel No room service menu in the room so didnt even eat there Also, we booked a Friends & Family Rate which stated it includes ""complimentary valet"" and ""preferred"" access to rooftop bar. We were still charged $30 for valet and rooftop host said bar/seating was reserved all weekend so we ended up going to another hotel to enjoy a rooftop bar and food. I was looking forward to the igloos and/or enjoying the rooftop so that was very disappointing. Like I said still a very nice place but wasnt a 4 or 5 star experience for my family. Ive been to nice hotels all over and they def dropped the ball this weekend. Hope you guys improve for future guest and best of wishes! ‚ù§","4.0","5.0","","4 months ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWwjN_w7UGl87-wP4qSvcSKB5Rt4F-mcv4gfXk | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDnXT38UlJ7LEAcdrgs-b_Sk4ZPqt1FU7qEfu6 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYfAzNzBwIky-p_dBdI7Hk5cZ_0ayULYISX4f0 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgYq5Pt-fAKEwE7h02imUef9agpKd8UKSLN7NP | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCfwpmmygc1XKbIqr4u27az6Nn6AYDwUYlbo4w | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt10yITENWl6vaX0wvpct3ADv1gZHbosBJepgQ | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNvZTDivEEH5MQsxlpTsDQWldfrvapLZCNW2yh","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106431568893819742419/reviews?hl=en-IL&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje3ZXKmMXvAhVDVhoKHZ7pBBAQvfQBegQIARAW","www.google.com","","Bobby Hotel","656","4,6","230 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIwpqN7I7647TuARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=EMKajeyO-uO07gEQwpqN7I7647TuATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwio_MejmMXvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjY1OWNjYWZlZTlmOjB4ZWU2OThmZDBlZDgzNGQ0MhoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYFhIHCOUPEAMYFxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4"
"Sheila Loberg","This is for anyone planning a wedding and looking for accommodations or event space... The Bobby treated the room block and our welcome party like a hard negotiation with up selling, confusing terms, prices over the top then not willing to accommodate us. Post COVID- we tried to rent 6 cabanas that hold 6 people each as opposed to having a full contract with F/B minimums. Well they didn‚Äôt like that and quickly told us that cabanas had a $750 f/b minimum per table and they wouldn‚Äôt be guaranteed until we booked a private space. No where on their resy website does it state either of those conditions and quite frankly my entire experience was dishonest. The two stars are one for the rooftop views and one for the fact that I got engaged here and had a great experience. Other then that, I just think there are so many better options now in Nashville like the Westin, Kimpton Aertson, LA Jackson and more to do rooftop parties with wedding blocks. Do not waste your time and definitely do not allow dishonest business practices to cloud your judgment as out of town guests.","2.0","5.0","","6 months ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102201205163229959495/reviews?hl=en-PT&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_nM3NmMXvAhVIrxoKHXa3BIYQvfQBegQIARAJ","www.google.com","","Bobby Hotel","656","4,6","230 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIwpqN7I7647TuARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=EMKajeyO-uO07gEQwpqN7I7647TuATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwio_MejmMXvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjY1OWNjYWZlZTlmOjB4ZWU2OThmZDBlZDgzNGQ0MhoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYFhIHCOUPEAMYFxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4"

"Sara Orcutt","I'm blown away by the service from the staff. Everyone from valet (Will and Anthony), front desk (Rachel, Dan and Sam), room service, and Kaila, our server at the Tavern restaurant were so friendly to my son and I. The Tavern doesn't have a kids menu but they have options if you ask- they make a great grilled cheese sandwich! I had the Bear Creek Bolognese and it was excellent! For room service during our stay we had the truffle fries, spinach and artichoke dip, and caesar salad from the cafe menu and all of it was delicious! The room was clean and spacious, comfortable beds, great desk space that I was able to do work at, and the shower is large with great heat and water pressure). We had a room on a high floor above 4th avenue so we had an excellent view over the area. Sasha, the hotel dog, is so sweet and friendly - a very pleasant surprise - especially for my son who is a huge dog lover! The COVID policies in place made everything feel safe. We would definitely recommend and would love to come back!","5.0","5.0","","3 weeks ago","","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115418870820200186472/reviews?hl=en-FI&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjg2rHGmMXvAhVGxIsKHdzDDtMQvfQBegUIARCSAQ","www.google.com","","Bobby Hotel","656","4,6","230 4th Ave N, Nashville, TN, United States","ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4","https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/entity/CgsIwpqN7I7647TuARAB/reviews?g2lb=2502548%2C2503781%2C4258168%2C4270442%2C4306835%2C4308227%2C4317915%2C4328159%2C4371335%2C4401769%2C4419364%2C4463666%2C4466981%2C4472151%2C4482438%2C4486153%2C4491350%2C4511371%2C4523593%2C4270859%2C4284970%2C4291517&hl=en-US&gl=us&ssta=1&rp=EMKajeyO-uO07gEQwpqN7I7647TuATgCQABIAcABAg&ictx=1&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwio_MejmMXvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg&utm_campaign=sharing&utm_medium=link&utm_source=htls&ts=CAESABpJCisSJzIlMHg4ODY0NjY1OWNjYWZlZTlmOjB4ZWU2OThmZDBlZDgzNGQ0MhoAEhoSFAoHCOUPEAMYFhIHCOUPEAMYFxgBMgIQACoJCgU6A1VTRBoA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJn-6vzFlmZIgRQk2D7dCPae4"
